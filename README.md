# Traffic-Light-Controller
Today’s lab is about a traffic light controller where we will be designing a finite state machine that is capable of controlling traffic lights at a street intersection. There are two orthogonal streets A and B, where A is the primary state and has a higher precedence over street B. There is a sensor at street B that detects if there are any car waiting on street B. If the sensor detects a car, it will have a output 1 with value “High” or a value “Low” if there is no car on street B. If we have a green signal at street A, it must be green for at least 60 seconds. If there is no car on street B i.e. if the sensor doesn’t detect any car then signal A stays green always. If the sensor detects a car on street B, then signal A turns orange for 10 seconds and then signal B turns Green with signal A turning Red. Now when street B has green signal, it stays green for duration of 30 seconds before turning orange for 10 seconds and then to red. Once signal B turns red, signal A turns to green again. So based on the above specs about Traffic Light Controller, we have to write a source file and a test bench using Verilog.
